**Great, this is exactly the right moment to step back and build a map before we dive into models.**

We’re not going to pick “one volatility model” or “one risk metric.”  
We’re building categories of “lenses” through which the model can look at risk.

Think of each category as a different sense: sight, hearing, touch… each gives a different kind of information. Some are more “pro-like”, some are more “super-human / anomaly-hunting”, and all together they give us the foundation for a preference system.

I’ll give you:

1) The philosophy of categories (why we need them)  
2) A clean list of risk method categories aligned with our “convexity / critical thinking” doctrine  
3) For each category: what it means, what question it answers, and examples (we’re NOT choosing yet, just seeing what lives there)

---

## 1) Why categories of methods (and not just “throw everything in”)?

Right now, risk literature is a bazaar:

- Some people say: “Risk = volatility” → standard deviation, GARCH, etc.【turn0search2】  
- Some say: “Risk = tail loss” → VaR, CVaR, tail metrics【turn0search6】【turn0search9】  
- Some say: “Risk = drawdown pain” → max drawdown, Calmar ratio, etc.【turn0search16】  
- Some say: “Risk = behavior and perception” → loss aversion, risk perception, herding metrics【turn0search10】【turn0search14】

If we just list 50 methods, we have no structure to:

- Compare them fairly (apples vs apples)  
- Know which are redundant (same category, different flavor)  
- Know where our blind spots are (which categories are empty)  
- Build a preference system (we must decide which categories we “prefer” to dominate our decisions)

So we create categories so we can say:

“We care more about Category X (tail / ruin) than Category Y (symmetric volatility), and we will build the preference system around that.”

That’s the “seeking” you asked for: we’re seeking the right classification of the problem space before we solve it.

---

## 2) The risk method categories aligned with our doctrine

I’ll give you 10 core categories. You can add or refine later, but this is a strong starting skeleton:

1) Structural / Ruin Risk  
2) Volatility & Noise Categories  
3) Downside & Tail Categories  
4) Drawdown & “Pain” Categories  
5) Asymmetry & Convexity Categories  
6) Exposure & Leverage Categories  
7) Liquidity & Market-Structure Categories  
8) Behavioral & Perception Categories  
9) Narrative & Information-Structure Categories  
10) Cross-Asset & Systemic Categories

Now let’s walk through each in a philosophical + practical way.

---

### Category 1: Structural / Ruin Risk

**Philosophy:**  
Everything else is detail if we can die. The first question is: "Is this trade capable of killing me?"

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that measure how close we are to an unrecoverable state:

- Distance to ruin (how many losses of size X until we blow up)  
- Probability of ruin over time  
- Survival / extinction metrics (more from risk-of-ruin theory than standard finance)  
- Capital impairment vs. account health

**The key question:**  
"If this bet goes wrong repeatedly, do I survive, or is this game over?"

**Typical methods / models in this bucket (we're not choosing, just mapping):**  
- Risk-of-ruin formulas  
- Capital-at-ruin calculations  
- Survival probabilities under different betting fractions

**Why it matters for us:**  
This is our master category. Any trade that threatens ruin gets crushed, no matter how good the other categories look.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P0 (Critical)** - Core to the doctrine; needed for baseline evaluation
- **Implementation: P0 (Weeks 1-4)** - Essential for constraint system and survival metrics

---

### Category 2: Volatility & Noise Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Not all volatility is risk. Some is "breathing," some is an earthquake. We want to distinguish noise from structural turbulence.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that describe how much and how prices move:

- "Standard" volatility: standard deviation of returns, historical vol【turn0search2】  
- Conditional volatility models (GARCH family, EWMA)  
- Implied volatility (from options, VIX-type indices)  
- Realized volatility vs. implied vol  
- Volatility regime models (low-vol vs high-vol states)  
- Intraday / microstructure noise

**The key question:**  
"Is the environment calm, stormy, or deceptively quiet?"

**Examples of what lives here:**  
- Simple rolling standard deviation  
- GARCH, EGARCH, etc.  
- VIX, option-implied vol surfaces  
- Vol-of-vol metrics

**Why it matters:**  
Pros often treat "low vol = safe." We treat "low vol = possibly hidden fragility." This category helps us detect phases and regimes where risk is compressed and may explode.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P1 (High)** - Needed for regime detection and conditioning other metrics
- **Implementation: P1 (Months 1-3)** - Start with simple std dev, expand to GARCH later

---

### Category 3: Downside & Tail Categories

**Philosophy:**  
We care a lot more about what happens when things go wrong than when they go right. This is where the "real" risk lives.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods focusing specifically on losses and extreme events:

- Downside deviation (only negative returns)  
- Semi-variance, semi-deviation  
- Value at Risk (VaR) – worst loss at some confidence level【turn0search6】【turn0search8】  
- Conditional VaR / Expected Shortfall – average loss in the tail【turn0search9】  
- Tail risk metrics (e.g., tail index, kurtosis-based measures)  
- Extreme value theory (EVT) models

**The key question:**  
"When things break, how bad can it get, and how often?"

**Examples here:**  
- VaR (parametric, historical, Monte Carlo)  
- CVaR / Expected Shortfall  
- Skewness and kurtosis of returns  
- EVT-based tail estimators

**Why it matters:**  
This is the first serious step beyond "volatility = risk." It aligns with our obsession with ruin and extreme outcomes. It also helps us spot fat tails and asymmetry in the PnL distribution.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P0 (Critical)** - CVaR directly used in loss functions; tail events core to testing
- **Implementation: P0 (Weeks 1-4)** - VaR/CVaR needed for Phase 2 risk-aware losses

---

### Category 4: Drawdown & "Pain" Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Humans don't feel volatility; they feel drawdowns and time under water. Duration of pain often breaks traders more than size of loss.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that measure the shape and duration of equity-curve damage:

- Maximum drawdown  
- Average drawdown  
- Drawdown duration (time underwater)  
- Drawdown frequency  
- Pain indices (e.g., Ulcer Index, Sterling ratio, Calmar ratio)【turn0search16】  
- Recovery time metrics

**The key question:**  
"How long and how deep is the pain if I'm wrong, and how fast do I come back?"

**Examples here:**  
- Max DD, average DD  
- Calmar ratio (return / max drawdown)【turn0search16】  
- Ulcer Index, etc.

**Why it matters:**  
For our "better-than-human" model, we want to quantify not just "how much can I lose" but "how long can I endure this without breaking the system or the strategy?" This is critical for sizing and for deciding when to reduce exposure.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P1 (High)** - Key evaluation metric; connects to human psychology model
- **Implementation: P1 (Months 1-3)** - Simple to implement; needed for benchmark suite

---

### Category 5: Asymmetry & Convexity Categories

**Philosophy:**  
This is the core of our "ism": we want setups that are convex—small downside, large upside. We prefer positions that benefit from disorder, not ones that shatter under it.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that compare upside vs downside and capture asymmetry:

- Sortino ratio (downside deviation instead of standard deviation)【turn0search16】  
- Omega ratio (probability-weighted gains vs losses above/below a threshold)【turn0search15】【turn0search17】  
- Gain-loss ratio  
- Skewness (third moment)  
- Higher-moment measures (asymmetry, tail shape)  
- "Convexity / curvature" metrics (e.g., option gamma profiles, payoff curvature)

**The key question:**  
"Does this bet have a skewed payoff where I lose a little if wrong but make a lot if right?"

**Examples here:**  
- Sortino, Omega, Calmar, etc.【turn0search16】  
- Omega ratio is especially interesting because it explicitly uses a threshold and weights gains vs losses【turn0search15】  
- Skew-based and tail-asymmetry measures

**Why it matters:**  
This category is the mathematical expression of our philosophy:  
- Prefer convexity (CI > 1)  
- Avoid concave traps (CI < 1)

Later, we can use methods from this category as the backbone of our "Convexity Score / Index."

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P0 (Critical)** - Core doctrine; backbone of preference system
- **Implementation: P0 (Months 3-6)** - Central to Phase 3 policy development

---

### Category 6: Exposure & Leverage Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Risk is not only about the market; it's about how much of ourselves we put into the market. Exposure decides how violently risk affects us.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that describe size, leverage, and sensitivity:

- Gross and net exposure  
- Leverage ratios (notional / equity, delta-adjusted exposure)  
- Beta vs market or factors【turn0search0】  
- Factor exposures (style, sector, macro factors)  
- Contribution to risk (which positions contribute most to portfolio risk)

**The key question:**  
"How much of my capital is actually exposed, and to what factors?"

**Examples here:**  
- Position sizing metrics, gross exposure %, net exposure %  
- Beta, factor loadings【turn0search0】  
- Risk contribution / marginal contribution to risk

**Why it matters:**  
This is where risk preference turns into actual constraints. Two identical trades can have totally different risk profiles depending on leverage. This category will be a big part of how the AI controls itself.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P1 (High)** - Links risk metrics to actionable constraints
- **Implementation: P1 (Months 3-6)** - Needed for position sizing in policy layer

---

### Category 7: Liquidity & Market-Structure Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Risk in theory is one thing. Risk in a thin, panicked market is another. We need to see "where the doors are" and how narrow they are.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that measure how easily we can enter/exit and how the market structure behaves:

- Bid–ask spread, depth-of-book, market impact measures  
- Liquidity-adjusted VaR  
- Turnover and volume patterns  
- Order-flow and microstructure metrics  
- Market tightness, resiliency, depth metrics

**The key question:**  
"If I need to get out fast, how much will it cost me, and can I even get out?"

**Examples here:**  
- Spread metrics, volume-at-price, impact models  
- Liquidity VaR variants  
- Intraday liquidity indicators

**Why it matters:**  
Pros sometimes underestimate liquidity risk until it's too late. Our "better-than-human" model should actively detect situations where liquidity is drying up, creating both danger and opportunity (e.g., forced-selling anomalies).

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P2 (Medium)** - Important for realistic scenarios; can start simple
- **Implementation: P2 (Months 6-10)** - Add after core metrics; start with volume-based proxies

---

### Category 8: Behavioral & Perception Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Humans don't just respond to "objective" risk; they respond to what they feel risk to be. That distorted perception is itself a source of edge.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that capture biases, emotions, and crowds:

- Loss aversion / risk propensity metrics【turn0search10】  
- Herding behavior indices  
- Overconfidence / sentiment indicators  
- Survey-based risk perception scores  
- Behavioral risk scores built from decision patterns (e.g., deviation from rational rules)【turn0search14】

**The key question:**  
"How is the market (or the trader) perceiving risk right now, and how is that perception distorted?"

**Examples here:**  
- Sentiment indices, put/call ratios as fear proxies  
- Behavioral risk scales from finance literature【turn0search14】  
- Metrics for anchoring, herding, overreaction【turn0search10】

**Why it matters:**  
We want our AI to be like a calm psychologist watching a panicked room. This category supplies the inputs to detect:

- When pros are too scared (opportunity)  
- When pros are too calm (fragility)  
- When the trader (or the crowd) is in "gambling mode"

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P1 (High)** - "Better-than-human" differentiator; anomaly detection
- **Implementation: P2 (Months 6-10)** - After core metrics; requires sentiment data pipeline

---

### Category 9: Narrative & Information-Structure Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Markets are not just numbers; they are stories and information flows. Risk lives where the story and the reality diverge.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that quantify information flows, narratives, and anomalies:

- News / social media sentiment and tone  
- Information flows (earnings surprises, macro data vs expectations)  
- Cross-asset narrative divergences (e.g., equity vs bond story disagreement)  
- Event-study-type frameworks around shocks  
- Surprise indices, data-dispersion metrics

**The key question:**  
"What story is the market telling, and what does the underlying data actually say?"

**Examples here:**  
- Sentiment NLP scores, news volume, disagreement dispersion  
- Surprise indices (macro vs forecast)  
- Regime detection tied to information shocks

**Why it matters:**  
This is where we catch "anomalies" and "what others cannot see." It's the core of our "critical thinking, pattern-hunting" layer: we detect narrative–price dislocations that pros ignore or explain away.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P1 (High)** - Critical thinking layer; LLM natural advantage
- **Implementation: P3 (Months 10-14)** - Advanced feature; requires NLP pipeline and multi-source data

---

### Category 10: Cross-Asset & Systemic Categories

**Philosophy:**  
Risk doesn't live in one instrument. It travels through networks. We need to see how risk propagates.

**What this category covers:**  
Methods that look at risk across instruments, markets, and the whole system:

- Correlation matrices, dependence structures  
- Copula models (tail dependence)  
- Systemic risk indicators (e.g., cross-market stress measures)  
- Contagion metrics, network-based risk measures【turn0search4】

**The key question:**  
"If something breaks over there, how does it travel here?"

**Examples here:**  
- Correlation, cointegration  
- Copula-based dependence  
- Systemic risk / cross-asset stress metrics【turn0search4】

**Why it matters:**  
Pros often manage each trade or book in isolation. Our AI should see the whole web: where risk is concentrated, where contagion is building, and where one breakdown in one area creates an asymmetric opportunity elsewhere.

**Priority:**  
- **Research: P2 (Medium)** - Portfolio view essential but can start single-asset
- **Implementation: P3 (Months 10-14)** - Extension phase; requires multi-asset data infrastructure

---

## 3) How these categories support your goal (pro-level + better-than-human)

Here’s how this map serves your vision:

- **Pro-level:**  
  - Categories 1–7 are what good risk managers and traders already use (structural, volatility, tail, drawdown, asymmetry, exposure, liquidity). We can pick best-in-class methods from each.
- **Better-than-human:**  
  - Categories 8–10 (behavioral, narrative/info, systemic) are where most pros either rely on intuition or ignore. By turning them into explicit categories and metrics, we create the space for the model to “see what they cannot.”

We can later define a preference system like:

- “In our doctrine, Category 1 (Ruin) and Category 5 (Asymmetry/Convexity) dominate.  
- Categories 2,3,4 are used to tune and condition the preference.  
- Categories 8–10 are used as anomaly detectors and opportunity filters.”

Next logical step (when you're ready) would be:

- For each category, define 1–3 "candidate method families"  
- Then decide: "Which ones do we want to explore first?" and "How do we combine their outputs into a single preference / conviction score?"

But for now, we have the main thing you asked for: a philosophical map of risk method categories, built from the ideas we've developed, not just a random list of formulas.
